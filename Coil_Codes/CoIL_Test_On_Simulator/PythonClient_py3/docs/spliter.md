For the splitter class there are several
requirements that must be attended.

Split by value

Considers a real number, depending on this real number it
splits the data in parts, as decided by the user.

Split by labels,

Consider labels, put different lables on different splits
depending on the parmeters


There is also the representation of a single ID
it could be associated with any number of measurements.
For that we should call two functions

* Verify labels: Based on one ID verify the label looking at the
                 number of frames.

* Verify Value: Based on one ID verify the general behaviour of the
                labels.


TODO: Check who should consider any skip, to avoid any bigger
overlap between the number of images when using more than one
image ( LSTM strategies)
